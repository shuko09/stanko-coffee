              Kick van Doorn is a true Amsterdam native. Apart from his work
              with STANKO, he's also running his own gig, a Branding &
              Communication agency called Skandl. Kick's been in the event scene
              for a bit, putting together club nights and art happenings. He's
              got a background in Sociology from the University of Amsterdam.
              Plus, he started off young as a barista in the coffee world. He's
              worked at places like Two For Joy, Coffee Roasters - that's where
              he met Nicole - and also at Back to Black Coffee, The Meets, and
              Charley's. Opening their own coffee shop has been a big dream for
              him, and STANKO is the start of making that happen

              in International Business & Languages, which means she's pretty
              savvy with finances. Nicole's been in the coffee game for nearly a
              decade, so she's definitely a pro when it comes to being a
              barista. At STANKO, Nicole's taking her baking passion to a whole
              new level.

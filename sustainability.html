              STANKO offers all types of coffees. They work closely with Back to
              Black Coffee and their green bean importers. The Back to Black
              importers roast their own coffee and have been in the business for
              a very long time. They do not only have their own shops, but they
              also offer a variety of services including coffee memberships to
              individuals but also offer other specialty coffee shops (not the
              kind you’re thinking of) to sell ethically sourced coffee. They
              hand select the unroasted coffee bean importers and stimulate to
              bring knowledge to the coffee bean farmers on how to work more
              ethically correct; Higher prices for labor &. the best ways to
              store the coffee. The importers they work closely with are: This
              Side Up & Cultivar.

              The snacks that STANKO offers are carefully selected by and with
              the family of the two owners; Kick van Doorn and Nicole Lieuw.
              They sell delicious Surinamese pastries and other delicious
              foreign foods. They offer a special order service for individuals
              to buy in “bulk”, like a bag of cookies instead of just one, a
              whole loaf of cake instead of just one slice or a whole pie
              instead of just one piece.
